### Instructions

To get the darker version on your setup, go to Bitwig Settings > User Interface > Contrast and set Midtones = 0, Black Level = 0 and Gridlines = 100

### Extras

I've included a palette of colors to use for track/event colors in your projects. This should be placed in your Bitwig Studio directory e.g. 

```
'~/Documents/Biwig Studio/Color Palettes'
```

I've also changed the color of some (but not all) of the icons used in Bitwig's browser to help tie the theme together. On MacOS these should replace some of the files in 

```
'/Applications/Bitwig Studio.app/Contents/Resources/icons/browser'
```
