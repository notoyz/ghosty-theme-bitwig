EXTRA:

I've included a palette of colors to use for track/event colors in your projects. This should be placed in your Bitwig Folder e.g. ~/Documents/Biwig Studio/Color Palettes

I've also changed the color of some (but not all) of the icons used in Bitwig's browser to help tie the theme together. On MacOS these should replace some of the files in /Applications/Bitwig Studio.app/Contents/Resources/icons/browser
